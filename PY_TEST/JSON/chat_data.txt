10:03 AM Michael Nemeth (to All): no outside traffic
10:03 AM Irene Arustamov (to All): no traffic will get in?
10:04 AM Michael Jacobsen (to Organizers): can't hear it
10:04 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to All): so, if it goes down, AWS will pay us? LOL
10:04 AM Michael Jacobsen (to Organizers): I meant we can't hear the printer

10:11 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): Sorry. What are the 5 again?
10:11 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): thanks
10:21 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to All): If my EC2 has two ENIs, I get two IP addresses, yet the ports are still the same on the EC2 isntance.
Hence, Security groups are always defined at the EC2 level and not at the ENI level, right?
10:23 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to All): Then, while associating a security group to EC2 isntance, it does not ask for the ENI, does it?

10:39 AM To All: @ Lee / @ All.... AWS Privatelink example.... https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/aws-privatelink.html
10:44 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Is PrivateLink an alternative to VPC Peering?
10:44 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): sounds definitely an improvement.
10:46 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Sure :)
10:47 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Fail over
10:48 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): 1 gb?
10:48 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): damn...
10:52 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): no
10:52 AM Irene Arustamov (to All): yes
10:52 AM Alan MacColl (to All): yes
10:52 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): does not it depend on the protocol
10:52 AM George II V Dimalanta (PRIVATE): yes
10:52 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): like https etc
10:52 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Ok
10:53 AM George II V Dimalanta (PRIVATE): no
10:54 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Yes
10:54 AM Viatcheslav Gorelik (to All): n
10:54 AM Alan MacColl (to All): yes
10:54 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): maybe
10:54 AM Irene Arustamov (to All): n
10:54 AM Irene Arustamov (to All): vpn
10:55 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): get a second line
10:55 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): put one more line from another DX partner or from teh same
10:55 AM Irene Arustamov (to All): second
10:57 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): nope
10:57 AM Irene Arustamov (to All): yes
10:57 AM George II V Dimalanta (PRIVATE): yes
10:57 AM Viatcheslav Gorelik (to All): y
10:57 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): yes, if you connect them
10:58 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): yes
10:58 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): no
10:58 AM Michael Nemeth (to Organizers): no
10:59 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Security Groups and NACLs
10:59 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): ?
10:59 AM Dave Yenser (to All): SG
10:59 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): acl
10:59 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): NACL
11:00 AM Irene Arustamov (to All): no
11:00 AM Michael Nemeth (to Organizers): no
11:00 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): nope
11:00 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): yes
11:00 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): no...
11:09 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): Is there a cost difference between VPC peering and TGW?It seems like migrating from VPC-P to TGW would be hard. So, Starting with TGW seems better if you expect growth.
11:10 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): Thanks. That was my thought.
11:14 AM JORGE MORENO (to All): same region only
11:14 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): I dont think so
11:14 AM Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): VPC endpoint only supports same region
11:14 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): URLs are global
11:17 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): So, the difference btween PrivateLink and Peering is that - Peering allows all EC2 instances inboth the VPCs/subnets (provided routs) discoverable, while private link does not? is that right
11:18 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Sure,, thanks
11:19 AM Antonio Vargas (PRIVATE): So it can change
11:19 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): ip addresses can change
11:20 AM Dave Yenser (to Organizers): managed
11:20 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): managed service
11:25 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): Do you configure NLB and ALP explicitly? Or does the ELB protocol determine the actual balancing type?
11:27 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): thx
11:29 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): atleast 2
11:29 AM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): 2
11:29 AM Irene Arustamov (to All): at least 2
11:29 AM George II V Dimalanta (PRIVATE): 2
11:30 AM Michael Nemeth (to Organizers): depends on budget
11:31 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): they are AZ local
11:31 AM George II V Dimalanta (PRIVATE): better connection internally
11:31 AM Michael Nemeth (to Organizers): route traffic between internal and external traffic
11:37 AM Dave Yenser (to Organizers): Can you resend lab link
11:38 AM To All: Please login here for labs... https://aws.qwiklabs.com/
11:38 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): A qq - Can we add read replicas to Dynamo DB?
11:39 AM Michael Jacobsen (to All): You said that AWS networking was complicated. When do you start showing that? ;-)
11:40 AM To All: @ Srikanth... DynamoDB is a managed service. So, we can create global tables across multi-region setup. Each replica stores the same set of data items. Any given global table can only have one replica table per AWS Region.
11:40 AM Charisma Island (PRIVATE): Hi Dipen can you please add me to the labs?
11:41 AM To Charisma Island (PRIVATE): Which email I should use?
11:41 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): What if I dont have multi-region need?
11:41 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): In a given region, I will get one read-replica though, right?
11:41 AM Charisma Island (PRIVATE): islandch@amazon.com
11:41 AM To Charisma Island (PRIVATE): Added
11:42 AM Charisma Island (PRIVATE): Cool thanks
11:42 AM To Srikanth Irukulla (PRIVATE): We create a table in a given region. Here there is no concept of read-replicas. As we read from this table, we need to manage Read Capacity Unit (RCU) and Write Capacity Units (WCU) for the table.
11:43 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Ok, the reason I ask is that
1 RCU = 1 Strongly Consistent Read = 2 Eventual Consistent Reads
11:44 AM To Srikanth Irukulla (PRIVATE): yes
11:44 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): So, it must be spending the 1 RCU to read from two instances to make sure it returns the latest values
11:44 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): value*
11:46 AM To Srikanth Irukulla (PRIVATE): When it is configured for strong consistency
11:48 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): One more question on RDS - when we set an RDS for Multi-AZ, we get a standby instance (that is in live sync) in a different AZ, is that right?
11:48 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Or, will there be any additional instance created in teh same AZ?
11:50 AM To Srikanth Irukulla (PRIVATE): Multi-AZ will set up another instance in different AZ which remain in sync with primary
11:56 AM Srikanth Irukulla (to Organizers): Thanks Dipen
12:04 PM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): what is a "blackhole"?
12:05 PM To Srikanth Irukulla (PRIVATE): that means, traffic route is broken... destination does not exist.
12:05 PM Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): unsure if i did something wrong, but i'm getting gateway timeout when trying to save the DB settings
12:05 PM To Leroy Lemon (PRIVATE): that means, traffic route is broken... destination does not exist.
12:05 PM To Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): checking
12:05 PM To Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): please provide your url here
12:05 PM Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): and now i cant seem to get back to the public IP - http://3.231.168.167/
12:06 PM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): the peering connection is pending acceptance for status.
12:07 PM To Leroy Lemon (PRIVATE): checking
12:07 PM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): I missed that step...
12:07 PM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): just accepted
12:07 PM To Leroy Lemon (PRIVATE): perfect...
12:08 PM Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): oh...i think i might have skipped editing the shared route table
12:08 PM To Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): :). let's try again...
12:09 PM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): unable to establish a db connection, I'll trace my steps.
12:09 PM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): must be missing something.
12:09 PM To Leroy Lemon (PRIVATE): Check SG and RouteTables...
12:09 PM To Leroy Lemon (PRIVATE): these are usually the culprit for the error
12:10 PM Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): yes...that was it. sorry!
12:10 PM To Vincent Giovanatto (PRIVATE): great... thanks
12:12 PM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): actually it was me using autocomplete instead of pasting in the proper endpoint and user name.
12:12 PM Leroy Lemon (to Organizers): all is good.
1:06 PM To Leroy Lemon (PRIVATE): Great.... thanks
1:11 PM Lee Anderson (to Organizers): I got pulled away for work reasons. I'd like a chance to finish it later if that's ok?
