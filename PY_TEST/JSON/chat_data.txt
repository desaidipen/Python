Good morning

8:58 AMAlberto Espinosa (to All):
I have a couple of questions, if we can fit them in somewhere today. 1) for web apps like in the lab, the end users of the web app do not need to be set up in AWS IAM, correct? 2) Our IT department manages several web apps managed by 3 different devops teams. Is it recommended to have all devops teams and apps in the same cloud account/workload, or separate ones?
