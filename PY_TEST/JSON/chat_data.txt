8:44 AMTo All:
@ PK..... ServiceMesh is optional, but it brings additional ability/functionality... In terms of additional layer of security, B/G Deployment, Controlling the type of requests, etc

2:02 PMPodupuganti K Rao (to All):
@Dipen - Why port number is used in step 47/48 (Lab4) to connect to backend service even after having service mesh...

2:03 PMTo All:
let me check

2:04 PMTo All:
@ PK... which lab you are working on?

2:04 PMPodupuganti K Rao (to All):
this is from previous one...Lab 4

2:07 PMTo All:
Oh, Ok.... In this lab, we are deploying a clusterIP service. But we are also running that service on Port 9080. So from host, to send traffic directly to service, need to user localhost:port number

2:15 PMPodupuganti K Rao (to All):
hmm...aren't we calling rock service from within dj container......which ideally should be able to detect using the name rock.prodapp..and route the traffic

2:20 PMTo All:
In this case, we are trying to generate a response by invoking code running on the same pod.
