2:53 PM Brady Thrift (to All): It worked for me
2:54 PM Raisa Parveen Syeda (to All): are you using the ur: http://44.192.109.230/guacamole/#/
2:55 PM Greg Harper (to Presenter): I don't have this available in my qwiklabs account
2:56 PM To All: @ Greg , please try again.
2:56 PM Greg Harper (to Presenter): it works now
2:58 PM Raisa Parveen Syeda (to All): that worked,thanks!!
3:00 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): What is the folder location on RDP for C#
3:01 PM To All: C:\temp/workdir
3:01 PM To All: Find CSharp lab in workdir folder.
3:02 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Thanks
3:09 PM Brady Thrift (to All): I'm getting an error on Task 7 "An error occurred (AuthorizationHeaderMalformed) when calling the ListBuckets operation: The authorization header is malformed; a non-empty Access Key (AKID) must be provided in the credential."
3:09 PM To All: checking
3:10 PM Brady Thrift (to All): The credentials file has no id/key/token values
3:10 PM To All: Just remote the IAM  role "Student-Role" and re-attach to Windows EC2 instance.
3:10 PM To All: ** remove
3:12 PM Brady Thrift (to All): Ok, trying that now.
3:14 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Do I have to create a new IAM  key? Where do I find my Access Key and Secret Key
3:14 PM To All: @ Saurabh..... which step?
3:14 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Task 2
3:16 PM To All: File should be available.... if not no need to create a new one... please continue with task 3 then.
3:16 PM Lawson Cofield (to All): No IntelliJ :'(
3:17 PM Brady Thrift (to All): I renamed the credentials file and the aws s3 ls worked. It seems I had a bad credentials file.
3:17 PM Jiaqi Wang (to All): I cannot find the file either
3:17 PM Jiaqi Wang (to All): for step 2
3:17 PM To All: IntelliJ for java?
3:17 PM Raisa Parveen Syeda (to All): me too, went to step 3.
3:18 PM To All: Checking cloudformation template..... My guess is, since we have not provided any credentials earlier, file just simply doesnt exist.
3:19 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Step 3 Error -> Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".
3:19 PM Michael DiGiorgio (to All): Task 2 isn't asking you to do anything with access/secret keys right? It's just an overview
3:19 PM To All: @ Michael.... yes
3:19 PM Michael DiGiorgio (to All): later on you add a role for s3 and can run the ls command
3:19 PM Firas Wahdan (to All): That's expected output for task 3 I believe
3:19 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Oh got it. The error is expected
3:20 PM To All: :)
3:20 PM Jiaqi Wang (to All): and for step 5 I cannot find Student-Policy in Attach permissions policies, only Student-Boundary is valid
3:21 PM Michael DiGiorgio (to All): did you create it in step 4?
3:21 PM Jiaqi Wang (to All): Ah I skipped that lol
3:21 PM Michael DiGiorgio (to All): all good lolol
3:22 PM To All: @ All..... we have just a min left.
3:22 PM Brady Thrift (to All): Eclipse is asking for a secret access key
3:23 PM Eduardo Tostado (to All): Where do I find my AWS Access Key ID?
3:23 PM Sajid Nizami (to All): you don't need it.
3:24 PM Sajid Nizami (to All): assign role to your ec2.
3:24 PM Eduardo Tostado (to All): I have assigned the role and get the "non-empty access key must be provided" error when running the aws s3 ls command
3:25 PM Brady Thrift (to All): Try renaming the credentials file. It was causing me an issue. E.g., credentials_bak
3:25 PM Eduardo Tostado (to All): thanks Brady - that did the trick
3:26 PM Brady Thrift (to All): You're welcome
3:27 PM Brady Thrift (to All): The credentials file defaulted with:
[default]
aws_access_key_id =
aws_secret_access_key =
aws_session_token =
3:27 PM Michael DiGiorgio (to All): ahh so it won't see an empty access key and then try the role?
3:28 PM Michael DiGiorgio (to All): got it
3:30 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Done!

4:50 PM Prashanth Boovaragavan (to All): Logging off for the day. Will finish this lab later this evening.
4:50 PM To All: Thanks.... @ Prashanth B
4:57 PM Brady Thrift (to All): FYI, I had to change the region in the config file to ap-southeast-2. I'm not sure how it defaulted to this (credentials file??).
4:58 PM To All: that may be true.... but see if you can update that to us-east-1......
4:59 PM Brady Thrift (to All): OH. I figured out why. Apparently, the bucket I picked wasn't unique enough and it matched to a bucket there
5:01 PM To All: oh, that's first time one of my student have such an error.... interesting...
5:01 PM Brady Thrift (to All): I'm glad I could find something new :)

5:04 PM To All: @ Saurabh..... Which step?
5:04 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Step 3 for .NET. I finished all 7 TODOs and ran my code
5:05 PM To All: checking....
5:06 PM To All: when i remote desktop in windows instance, you may lose your session.
5:06 PM To All: data/work will not be lost...
5:06 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): okay
5:10 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): I might have missed TODO 7 (Enhanced file upload)
5:12 PM Raisa Parveen Syeda (to All): yes i tried caps and it didnt work

12:05 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): My Lab 1 and Lab 3 do not have a check mark. Looks like they are not marked as done. Even though I finished them.
12:08 PM To All: @ Saurabh... no worries, even I am trying to understand how 'qwiklabs' determine if a lab is done or not. :)
As long as you learned something from it, that matters.
12:08 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Alright thanks :)
12:14 PM To All: How is lab so far? we will be breaking for lunch at 12:20. Starting our next module at 1:20PM CST.

4:02 PM To Prashanth Boovaragavan (PRIVATE): Yes, not a problem at all...... labs are to ensure that you will have some practical experience with services that you can apply to your actual job.
4:03 PM Prashanth Boovaragavan (PRIVATE): Yeah I need to finish the backlogs before tomorrow since tomorrow is the last day. I will update you once I am done and if I have any questions related to any labs. Thank you
4:07 PM To Prashanth Boovaragavan (PRIVATE): Sure, np.... worse case, let me know by tomorrow so I can create another 3 day lab for you exclusively. So you can have weekend to cover them.

4:40 PM Brady Thrift (to All): For 3.7 I did update the code to output the count

4:42 PM Brady Thrift (to All): I just ran the Maven command
4:42 PM Brady Thrift (to All): Oh, I missed re-running a step
4:42 PM Brady Thrift (to All): the aws command

4:47 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Ahh got it!
4:48 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Also, this might be out of scope of the training, but how would I fetch an existing lambda locally to edit it?
4:51 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): I am sorry my internet connection dropped after you said it is not out of scope. :( Would you please repeat it?

11:18 AM Joseph Tran (to All): does it take a while for subscriptions to pop up in SNS?
11:19 AM To All: @ Joe... if it is a phone number then it may delay a bit..... My recommendation is to try with your email address.
11:19 AM Joseph Tran (to All): i used an email
11:20 AM Joseph Tran (to All): i got my confirmation email already and confirmed, but after i've subscribed to SNS it doesn't show up in my subscriptions list
11:22 AM Joseph Tran (to All): 100, java
11:24 AM Joseph Tran (to All): doublechecking but i don't believe so
11:24 AM Joseph Tran (to All): i do remember that the queues didn't show up until i messed with the search
11:24 AM Joseph Tran (to All): and then they populated, i figured it was a small glitch
11:26 AM Joseph Tran (to All): also noticed the steps are slightly outdated, i don't have an actions tab but found the subscribe to sns button directly
11:27 AM Joseph Tran (to All): ah the arn may be wrong, i'm east coast
11:27 AM Joseph Tran (to All): but the arn is west
11:30 AM Joseph Tran (to All): yep the access policy that was autogenerated took to a west resource instead of east
11:32 AM To All: 👍.... did it work after fixing it?
11:34 AM Joseph Tran (to All): ...nope
11:35 AM Joseph Tran (to All): i deleted and readded the queues, still nothing shows up in my SNS subscriptions
11:35 AM To All: Did you completed the code deployment part? Steps 102 onwards?
11:35 AM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Done. Got the email notification
11:35 AM Joseph Tran (to All): wait a minute
11:36 AM To All: Thanks.... Saurabh....👍
11:36 AM Joseph Tran (to All): that's strange, if i go directly through SNS the subscriptions won't show
11:36 AM Joseph Tran (to All): but if i go through SQS to each queue and select view from SNS and then go up a level they show
11:37 AM Joseph Tran (to All): yeah it's glitchy but i'm where i need to be
11:51 AM Brady Thrift (to All): For me (I didn't notice at first), I created the SNS topics in us-east-1. I opened the SQS page and the region changed to us-west-2 automatically and I created the SQS queues there. I had to re-create them in us-east-1 for them to work with the code.
11:52 AM Raisa Parveen Syeda (to All): +1
11:54 AM To All: That's very typical and that's why checking region is always most important part of the lab. This will also helps in actual environment.

11:55 AM Jiaqi Wang (to All): I saw the com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException shown when I run the tests, is that expected?
11:55 AM Michael DiGiorgio (to All): sorry was by accident
11:55 AM To All: @ Jiaqi, which language and step?
11:56 AM To All: @ Miachel... no worries
11:58 AM Joseph Tran (to All): must've ran into another similar issue, nothing is showing up in queues
12:00 PM Jiaqi Wang (to All): java step 131
12:00 PM Joseph Tran (to All): yep
12:00 PM Joseph Tran (to All): just a note i did receive an email indicating my pharmaceutical order
12:04 PM Joseph Tran (to All): yeah so the code works
12:04 PM Joseph Tran (to All): when i look at my queues in SQS nothing's populated
12:05 PM Joseph Tran (to All): yeah that's strange
12:05 PM Joseph Tran (to All): i think my browser's just having glitches overall
12:05 PM Brady Thrift (to All): You need to click the "Poll" button in the aws console
12:05 PM Joseph Tran (to All): first not seeing the subscriptions then not seeing the queues
12:06 PM Joseph Tran (to All): probably need to clear my cache or something but i'll move on if you're able to confirm my code worked as expected
12:07 PM Brady Thrift (to All): Joseph, try refreshing and make sure the regions match between SQS and SNS
12:08 PM Joseph Tran (to All): yep, somehow even though i made the queues to be east SNS has them up as west again...
12:09 PM Jiaqi Wang (to All): yup
12:10 PM To All: Lunch..... 1PM  for new module.
12:12 PM Joseph Tran (to All): oh NOW my queues show up >.<
12:59 PM To All: 😄
12:59 PM To All: May be it is working in different time zone.... 😂

2:31 PM To All: https://aws.training/Account/Transcript/Archived
2:31 PM Gangabarani Balakrishnan (to All): ah, got it.
2:32 PM Raisa Parveen Syeda (to All): thanks!
2:42 PM Prashanth Boovaragavan (PRIVATE): Hi Dipen, My internet connection got fixed very late last night, I was not able to find time to go over all labs. Is it possible to get an extension?
2:43 PM To Prashanth Boovaragavan (PRIVATE): let me work on that.... i will send you details in private.
2:52 PM Prashanth Boovaragavan (PRIVATE): thank you
2:53 PM Michael DiGiorgio (to All): @Dipen you weren't kidding about this changing the region on you a lot
2:56 PM To All: @ Michael.....😄😄
2:56 PM To All: this lab is really notorious about it.... not sure... no other lab in any other course does something like this.
3:13 PM To All: @ All.... be right back.... 10 mins
3:28 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Trying to publish my first lambda code to AWS (Step 83). The AWS Toolkit is asking for account profile to use
3:31 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Do I have to create an Access Key and import the csv here?
3:33 PM To All: @ Saurabh..... checking
3:34 PM To All: Are you deploying solution code / your own code?
3:35 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Solution
3:35 PM To All: Java / .NET?
3:35 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): .NET
3:37 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): okay
3:45 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): I copied in the notepad. It should be open
3:45 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): on the remote desktop
3:46 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): I can continue in JAVA if thats helpful. Im sure all the steps before creating the first lambda are same
3:50 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Yeah its weird. Ill try with Java
3:54 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Theres no eclipse on remote desktop
3:55 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): seems like the remote desktop creation might have had a problem
3:55 PM To All: that's strange... let me check one more time. If you want you have rights to download and install.
3:55 PM To All: If this is giving you a lot of trouble, then end the lab and re-start a new one.
3:57 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): I can download and install but I will not have the AWS toolkit extension set up
3:58 PM To All: true.... let's start a new lab.... hopefully that should fix issues.
3:58 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): alright
3:58 PM To All: we can extend the session to complete the lab. So that should be ok.
3:58 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): Thanks :)
4:03 PM Prashant Desai (to All): Is there logs for cognito in CloudWatch? After I login I see "Session Expired! Click here to login again"
4:03 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): I ended my lab and restarted it
4:04 PM To All: If session remains idle for a long time, it may happen. Let me check if user sessions logs are added to cloudwatch or not.
4:05 PM Prashant Desai (to All): I created another user, and logged in. After login it says Session Expired
4:06 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): interesting
4:06 PM To All: Need to check Cognito user pool settings.
4:08 PM To All: it all looks good.... try logging again with any of the existing users
4:09 PM To All: Previous authentication attemps seems to have succeeded correctly.
4:09 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): The lambda is also pushed?
4:09 PM To All: See if you can try in different browser / clear cache.
4:10 PM To All: I can see all lambda functions.
4:10 PM Prashant Desai (to All): http://polly-notes-web-p-d.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
4:10 PM Prashant Desai (to All): I tried firefox, safari, and chrome
4:10 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): I lost the password to the remote desktop because i ended the lab
4:11 PM Prashanth Boovaragavan (PRIVATE): anyone seeing this error ?
1 validation error detected: Value 'arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-east-1:260118273546:userpool/us-east-1_F5doNqCcR' at 'clientId' failed to satisfy constraint: Member must satisfy regular expression pattern: [\w+]+

4:13 PM Saurabh Bhalla (to All): that looks like userpool id in client id field
4:13 PM To All: @ Prashanth B.... that means clientID has incorrect format. Need to check again.
4:15 PM To All: @ Prashant Desai.... This is strange.... it takes you to home page, but login is not working.
4:16 PM Prashant Desai (to All): yeah
4:18 PM To All: API Gateway error is causing this....
4:19 PM To All: @ Prashant Desai.... Please recheck "API Gateway
4:19 PM Prashant Desai (to All): will do, thanks
4:20 PM To All: As per error, it seems like
4:20 PM To All: As per error, it seems like "GET" method is missing in "notes" end point.
4:21 PM Prashant Desai (to All): interesting .. it was working until I imported Swagger.
4:22 PM Prashant Desai (to All): override
4:22 PM Brady Thrift (to All): It defaults to override :(
4:23 PM Prashant Desai (to All): ok - got it. Will try it ..
4:24 PM Brady Thrift (to All): I'm finishing up the challenge part, why is the expression attribute value prefixed with "v_" ?
4:25 PM To All: https://kiku.aws.training/Account/Transcript/Archived
4:25 PM Brady Thrift (to All): I'm working on the challenge, writing the code. Java
4:25 PM Brady Thrift (to All): E.g., .withFilterExpression("contains (note, :v_note)")
4:26 PM Brady Thrift (to All): Ok, makes sense. I thought it might be some sort of special prefix
4:31 PM Brady Thrift (to All): Dipen, in terms of the exam, how long after the course(s) will the content remain relevant?
4:32 PM Brady Thrift (to All): I saw that same e-mail :)
